//DPX_BUGS_OVERRIDE  1
//  Legal values for DPX_BUGS_OVERRIDE:
//    -1 => Try to autodetect bugs (only works for some files)
//    0 => Standards-compliant
//    1 => Reads 8-bit files that were generated with padded line ends (see DPX_PAD_LINE_ENDS)
//    2 => Fixes common issue where BGR is stored as RGB and endianness is backwards (for example, ImageMagick output)
//    3 => For 16-bit files, swaps the 16-bit words within a 32-bit word
DPX_PAD_LINE_ENDS  1   // ie., start lines on 32-bit boundaries.  Required to output RGB to XNView 1.99 (but not YUV!)
